# grocery

Its a Grocery app with backend used Firebase.

This app comprises of a very simple user interface where
the user can easily find his desired item and order. One can search the items based on the provided
filters like price, category etc. There have been grocery apps before but the specialty of this app
is we can search the items with just taking the snap of the desired item. This has been possible by
developing a machine learning model which extracts the text from the given image. This app also
has a feature to develop insights of the app by calculating sentimental score from the reviews and
feedbacks provided by the users.
